# anki

# for what use
Place to create and manage Snyk related Anki material for onboarding, study, knowledge refresh, etc

# What is the organization ?
Decks to be organized under SnykCollab - meaning:
- in Anki they show up as SnykCollab::SubDeck
- In git they show up as SnykCollab-Subdeck.txt

# Why not keep them in one big file?
I think there would be a lot of Git merge conflicts to remediate?  
Also, people can more easily only import into Anki the decks they are interested in.  For example, there might be an easy, medium, advanced deck as people onboard?  Maybe you only want to import the easy deck?
